# Coffee Shop

## The Back Story 
Friends of mine opened a coffee shop earlier this year. I am developing a site for them to promote their business and to get information to customers. 

## Goals:
- The plan is to have a display site visable to all traffic with information about basic business information, address, current drinks, specials, prices,  etc.
- I also want to include a login option for the business owners where they can input information into the database, update information, and select which info to display on the public site. I plan to build this so all drinks are stored in the database but they are only visible when marked active.
- The goal is for this to be an easy to navigate site for the coffee shop owners so they can update their menu as the seasons change and maintain access to previous items.
